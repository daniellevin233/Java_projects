Book.java - contains the Book class implementation.
Patron.java - contains the Patron class implementation.
Library.java - contains the Library class implementation, which has its lists of patrons and books and
is managing it

=============================
Every patron holds in addition a vector of books he is borrowing at the current moment, this was made
to define which patron is reading some book to be able to return it - to take it from him

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In Patron class I created additional feature - list of borrowed books, I decided to implement it
as vector because certain patron doesn't have some capacity of books that he can borrow simultaneously,
so we don't know in advance the size of the data structure we will need. Vector is the comfortable one
to work with.

To implement id numbers, indexes of the current positions in arrays were chosen. Each book is added once,
and never taken out, so there is an injective function between the array indexes and books. That's why I
decided to use this feature. In addition to the moment of implementation, unfortunately,
we've not seen the static variables yet that were very useful for counting books objects.
The same thing was implemented for patron.
